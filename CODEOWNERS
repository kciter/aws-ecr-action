# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
# * @global-owner1 @global-owner2
* @LeafLink/devops

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.
